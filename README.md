## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This was the **first time** me and my friend undertook a project of a slightly larger scale than what we were used to.  
We acknowledge that:
- **Best coding practices were not always followed**  
- The code is **messy**   
- **Many features are yet to be implemented**  

The game was made specifically for a competition on waste segregation, and we had to **prioritize the core features** needed to present the game on that day. Future updates will aim to polish and expand the experience.
